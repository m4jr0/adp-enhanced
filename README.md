# ADP Enhanced

**ADP Enhanced** is a [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) that adds useful features to the ADP's activities webpage.

Currently, the script is in French only, and was written quickly during my work breaks (so bear in mind, the code can be a little bit tricky). It is therefore provided as is, without any warranty, under the **[MIT license](https://github.com/m4jr0/adp-enhanced/blob/master/LICENSE)**.

## Installation guide

You can add **ADP Enhanced** to your web browser by following the installation steps [here](https://github.com/m4jr0/adp-enhanced/wiki/Install-ADP-Enhanced).
